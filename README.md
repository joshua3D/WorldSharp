# WorldSharp
 A simple, bare-bones .Net Core CLI application for generating Overworld data for Roguelikes & RPGs written in C#
 
#### This project uses [FastNoise](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise) by [Auburn](https://github.com/Auburn)

 *Currently a work in process*

## Goals & Scope

### **A CLI**

A Command Line Interface will be used to generate either JSON or BITMAP files which represent procedural data about the Overworlds created

### **A DLL**

All the main functionality/framework of WorldSharp will be distributed as a DLL

### **An Example [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com/) project**

This will be used to demonstrate how the framework might be used in a game.
